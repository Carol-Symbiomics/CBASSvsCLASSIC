# CBASSvsCLASSIC
This repository contains the scripts used to run analyses and create figures for the manuscript “Standardized short‐term acute heat stress assays resolve historical differences in coral thermotolerance across microhabitat reef sites”, where we introduce our newly developed Coral Bleaching Automated Stress System (CBASS). This research provides a direct comparison between CBASS and the commonly used CLASSIC long-term aquarium heat stress experiments to demonstrate differences in coral thermotolerance shaped by short-scale environmental factors.
