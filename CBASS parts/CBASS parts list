CBASS parts

The Coral Bleaching Automated Stress System (CBASS) is an experimental system to conduct short‐term acute heat stress assays (see Figure). The system consists of 4 replicate 10 L flow‐through tanks that allows running four independent temperature profiles with light settings adjusted to match in situ light fields. The temperature in each tank is controlled by IceProbe Thermoelectric chillers (Nova Tec) and 200W titanium aquarium heaters (Schego) linked to a custom‐built controller (Arduino MEGA 2560); the light is controlled manually using an LI‐193 Spherical Underwater Quantum Sensor (LI‐COR) and manual adjustment of dimmable 165W full spectrum LED aquarium lights (Galaxyhydro) to match reef in situ light fields (~600 μmol quanta m−2 s−1). HOBO Pendant Temperature Data Loggers are used to record the temperature of each tank for the duration of the experiment.

Collected coral fragments from all seven colonies of both reef sites (exposed, protected) were distributed over the four replicated flow‐through tanks, so that fragments from each colony (i.e., genotype) were in each treatment condition (2 × control/baseline − 30°C, 2 × medium − 33°C, 2 × high − 36°C, 2 × extreme − 39°C), to make a total of 2 × 56 fragments (7 fragments × 2 sites per tank = 14; 14 fragments per tank × 4 temperatures = 56 × 2 replicated tanks = 112; all 112 fragments were used for pulse‐amplitude modulation (PAM) fluoro‐metry measurements, while for all other analyses a non‐replicated set was used, see below; Figure 1). The start of the experiment was at noon (12:00 hr) and the four treatment conditions were as follows: the control tank was maintained at 30°C for the entire experiment. The three short‐term acute heat stress treatment tanks were heated to 33°C, 36°C, and 39°C over a period of 3 hr. The respective temperature was held for 3 hr, and then decreased back to 30°C over the course of 1 hr (19:00 hr). All corals were kept at 30°C overnight until sampling the following morning (08:00 hr), completing the 18‐hr short‐term acute heat stress assay (August 16, 2018; Figure 1). All tanks were continuously supplied with Red Sea seawater (see above) and photosynthetic active radiation of 600 µmol photons m−2 s−1 on a 12:12 hr day/night cycle.
